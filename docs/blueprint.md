- Spectral Confidence Scoring: An AI tool scores the spectral confidence of articulated words based on forced alignment data, identifying and highlighting areas requiring vocal repair.
- Contextual EQ Profile Generation: An AI tool suggests targeted EQ profiles and audio processing parameters based on user-defined production context and desired sonic qualities (e.g., 'grimy boom-bap').
- Interactive Vocal Analysis Display: Present aligned lyrics, spectral confidence, and identified repair targets in an interactive user interface, allowing users to review and make precise adjustments.
- Export Engine: Enable users to export processed vocal audio incorporating all applied corrections and effects.
- Project & Data Persistence: Store user projects, lyrics, processing settings, and audio analysis results in a structured database.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, saturated red (#AE1B14) to signify intensity, urgency, and highlight critical information and interactive elements.
- Background color: A very dark, almost black hue with a subtle red tint (#130302), providing a focused, immersive, and rich ambiance consistent with the app's 'surgical' theme.
- Accent color: A vibrant golden-orange (#E1B135) to contrast with the dark primary, drawing attention to secondary actions, labels, and status indicators.
- Headlines: 'Bebas Neue' (sans-serif) for bold, impactful titles and primary branding elements. Body text: 'Space Mono' (monospace) for a technical, precise feel in informational sections. Editorial content/quotes: 'Playfair Display' (serif) for elegant, authoritative quotes and manifestos. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist, precise line icons with a technical or diagnostic aesthetic, aligning with the 'surgical' and analytical theme. Avoid overly playful or elaborate designs.
- A fixed sidebar navigation for persistent access to main sections, coupled with a main content area that strategically balances text-optimized narrow columns with full-width 'cinematic' sections for impact (e.g., hero and manifesto quotes). Grid-based structures will be used for organized data display.
- Subtle, deliberate animations for transitions, hover states, and data visualization. Emphasis on smooth opacity changes, discreet reveals, and micro-interactions to guide user attention without distraction, reinforcing a sense of precision.
